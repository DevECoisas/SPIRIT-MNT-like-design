# How to contribute:

1. Before making any changes, please open an issue on GitHub describing the change you wish to make.
This allows others to assess whether the proposed change is beneficial and if it aligns
with the project goals.

2. Once your issue is reviewed, and if it is confirmed that your change would be useful,
and no one else is currently working on it, you may proceed to make a pull request (PR).

3. When creating your PR, please include a detailed description in English that outlines exactly
what changes have been introduced. This helps others understand your contribution better.

4. After submitting your PR, kindly wait for your changes to be reviewed.
We appreciate your patience as we work to ensure quality and consistency in the project.

# Rules for smoother cooperation:

- Please use the newest major release of KiCad.

- If you add new parts, please ensure that they are available for purchase on [digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/), have public datasheets and are RoHS compliant.

- When adding new parts make sure to add them to the existing libraries for maintainability.

- Avoid massive pull requests that are hard to review. It is easier for
  everyone if you split your contribution into small, atomic pieces (within reason).

- Write all text in english.
