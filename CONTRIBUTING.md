# How to contribute:

1. To avoid wasting your time, please first open an issue describing the change you
wish to make. This way other maintainers can determine if the change should be
implemented.

2. After confirming that the change would be useful, and no one is currently
   working on it, please make a pull request and add a description in english
   describing exactly what changes you have introduced.

3. Kindly wait for your changes to be reviewed and hopefuly merged into the main
   branch.

# Rules for smoother cooperation:

- Avoid massive pull requests that are hard to review. It is easier for
  everyone if you split your contribution into smaller pieces (within reason).

- Write all text in english.
