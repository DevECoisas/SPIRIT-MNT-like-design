# How to contribute:

1. Before making any changes, please open an issue on GitHub describing the change you wish to make.
This allows the maintainers to assess whether the proposed change is beneficial and if it aligns
with the project goals.

2. Once your issue is reviewed, and if it is confirmed that your change would be useful,
and no one else is currently working on it, you may proceed to make a pull request (PR).

3. When creating your PR, please include a detailed description in English that outlines exactly
what changes you have introduced. This helps maintainers understand your contribution better.

4. After submitting your PR, kindly wait for your changes to be reviewed by the maintainers.
We appreciate your patience as we work to ensure quality and consistency in the project.

# Rules for smoother cooperation:

- Please use Kicad 8.

- Avoid massive pull requests that are hard to review. It is easier for
  everyone if you split your contribution into smaller pieces (within reason).

- Write all text in english.
