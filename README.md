# DIY Build Guide

Link to build guide/tutorial: COMING SOON!!!

# Parts List

_Coming soon!!!_

To get the most up-to-date parts list please look
at the BOM. Certain components such as the camera or the compute module can be swapped for a different
model - the presented setup is just a suggestion.

# Cost

_Coming soon!!!_

# Ethical And Environmental Concerns

SPIRIT phones avoid components produced in unfair or harmful ways, as well as
containing conflict minerals if possible.

The goal is to be 100% ethically and environmentally "clean" as soon as possible, however that is
a hard task and presents multiple enginnering challenges.

# Compliance And Legality

_Coming soon!!!_
